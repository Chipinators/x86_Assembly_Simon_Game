x86_Assembly_Simon_Game

This project is a recreation of the game "Simon"; a game which tests your memory by having you repeat the pattern which is given to you as it increments it's length by one with each succesful pass.

This was an assembly project written in x86 sssembly using the Irvine 32 library. This project was created by a team of three members (Maya Bloom, Chris Potter, Jonathan Keys), who all shared different responsibilities of the project.
